# Quick-Insertion
To improve the performance of quicksort program in worst case, we are now using insertion sort inside the quicksort algorithm such that we determine a threshold value and call insertion sort algorithm when threshold is &lt;= array elements. Since for few elements the time complexity of quick sort algorithm is high which is inefficient. We can improve its efficiency by passing the search elements to Insertion sort when the number of elements are less. This program is concerned with improving the performance of quicksort. The process is further explained in the repository with results and observations.
